VM's are cool...
But what if we made a better version somehow?
Namely... we typically need to start up a whole VM and this is so far a long process
(we could create templates for VMs on Azure, but still, they are bulky and have a long spinup time
and may be hard to change - recall how much work we had to do to install java and maven)
To speed up this process:

We strip VM's down a bit

Namely, typically a VM is an entire OS
But, at some point programmer found out how to 'simulate' virtualization while reusing
the computer's Operating System
Virtualization: the principle that a program exists in a 'sandbox' where it thinks it has
full access to the computer, but really, it does not
Introducing Docker, Docker containers

Docker installation:
    Windows, by default, never came with the right features to support this system,
    so you will need to make sure some things are in place to use Docker
        Enable Virtualization
        Powershell -
        Will require system restart
